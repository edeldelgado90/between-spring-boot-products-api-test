# between-spring-boot-products-api-test

## Description

This project is a Spring Boot-based application that exposes product information through REST and gRPC APIs.
It demonstrates a clean architecture following the Hexagonal Architecture pattern, allowing easy testing and
flexibility.
The service provides endpoints to retrieve product details and similar product IDs.

## Architecture

The architecture used in this project is **Hexagonal Architecture** (also known as Ports and Adapters).
The structure is divided into different layers:

### Adapters

Adapters are responsible for interacting with external systems and frameworks. In this project, we have:

- Inbound Adapters (receiving input):
    - `ProductController` (inside `adapter.in.rest`): Manages RESTful API requests.
    - `GRPCProductService` (inside `adapter.in.grpc`): Handles gRPC requests.
- Outbound Adapters (sending output):
    - `ProductService` (inside `adapter.out.rest`): Calls external REST services.

### Application Layer

This layer contains business logic and service orchestration:

- `config`: Configuration files.
- `dto`: Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) used for communication between layers.
- `mapper`: Utility classes for mapping between domain and DTOs.

### Domain Layer

The core of the system, defining business entities and rules:

- `product`: Contains product-related domain models.
- `error`: Handles domain-specific errors.

### Ports

Ports define the interfaces for communication between the core domain and adapters. In this project, we have:

- `Inbound Ports` (used by adapters to interact with the application):
    - `ProductInPort` (inside `port.in.rest`): Defines REST-based interactions.
- `Outbound Ports` (used by the application to communicate with external services):
    - `ProductOutPort` (inside `port.out.rest`): Defines interactions with external REST services.

## Features

- **REST API**: Exposes product details and similar product IDs.
- **gRPC API**: Exposes the same functionalities as the REST API but through a gRPC interface.
- **Resilience4j**: Circuit breakers, retries, and rate limiting are applied to ensure system resilience.
- **Caching**: Product data is cached to improve performance.
- **Timeouts and Retries**: Configured for handling time-sensitive requests.

## Requirements

- **Java 21** or later
- **Docker** (for containerized environment)
- **Maven** for building the project
- **gRPC** for gRPC-related functionalities
- **Spring Boot 2.x** or later
- **Redis** (optional, for caching support)

## Running the Application (Docker)

To run the application using Docker, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/edeldelgado90/between-spring-boot-products-api-test.git
   cd between-spring-boot-products-api-test
   ```
2. Build and run the Docker container:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

3. The application will be available at http://localhost:8080.

## Accessing the OpenAPI Documentation

Once the application is running, you can access the OpenAPI documentation at:

- URL: http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html
  This page allows you to interact with the REST API, view available endpoints, and try them out directly from the
  browser.

## REST API Endpoints

Here are the available REST API endpoints with example curl commands to access them:

### Get Similar Products

Endpoint: GET /product/{productId}/detail

```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/product/1/detail" -H "accept: application/json"
````

## gRPC Usage

To interact with the gRPC service, you can use `grpcurl`. Below are examples of how to access the gRPC endpoints.

### Get Product Details

```bash
grpcurl -plaintext -d '{"productId": 1}' localhost:9090 product.ProductService/getSimilarProducts
```
